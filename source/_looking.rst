Look Settings
=============

During an experiment, the experimenter can use the keyboard to tell Habit that the subject is looking at a stimulus, 
or that they are *not looking* at a stimulus. Habit uses a small set of rules, which are specified on the *Look Settings* page,
to interpret the pattern of looking. 

Habit interprets keypresses on the "4", "5", and "6" keys to indicate looking to the *left*, *center*, and *right*, respectively.
The choice of these keys makes sense when you think of the keys on a keyboard's keypad (if you are working on a laptop, you likely
don't *have* a keypad, but the "4", "5", and "6" keys are still used).

.. note:: If you are running an experiment which displays stimuli on a *single screen*, then you should always use the "5" key to indicate 
   looking at the *center* screen. If you are running an experiment which displays stimuli on *dual screens*, use the "4" ("5") key to 
   indicate looking at the *left* (*right*) screen. 
   
   For dual-screen experiments, this is especially important, as Habit will treat (and report on) looks to the *left* and *right* separately.
