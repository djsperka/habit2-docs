2. A summary results file, in csv format (can be viewed with Excel or Numbers)

   The *Results Explorer* dialog allows you to view results file(s) for completed experiments.


.. note:: Results files are named using the experiment name, subject ID (if any), and the date/time when the experimnent was 
   started
   
   For example, an experiment named "MyExperiment", run in test mode, and started on May 25, 2018, at 9:15am, would have 
   a results file named *MyExperiment_TEST_2018-05-25-0915.hab*
   
To view the results for a particular experiment, select the results file (\*.hab) and click the *Open* button (or just double-click
the results filename).

   the results of an experiment using the *Results Explorer* dialog. 
   
CSV Results File

Habit also exports a detailed results file in CSV format. This file can be viewed in a spreadsheet program (Microsoft *Excel*, 
or *Numbers* on the Mac).
