Phase Types
===========

Habit2 supports three types of phases, and phase type must be specified when “creating a new phase,” 
but can be changed or modified for any previously created phase. 
The **fixed number of trials** phases are simply phases that consist of a fixed number of trials—for 
example 2 pretest trials, 6 preference trials, 4 violation of expectation trials, 6 test trials. 
Such phases are not complete until all of the trials have been presented and completed successfully.
The settings for trials in the phase are used to determine what constitutes a "successful" trial.
